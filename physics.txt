Basic DC Motor Equations:

    Voltage equation:

V = IR + Kω  (where Kω is back-EMF)
V = Applied voltage (V)
I = Current (A)
R = Internal resistance (2Ω)
K = Motor constant (V/rad/s)
ω = Angular velocity (rad/s)

    Torque equation:

T = KI  (where K is same as above)
T = Torque (N⋅m)

    Motion equation for wheel:

T = J(dω/dt)  (during acceleration)
J = Moment of inertia (kg⋅m²)

For a wheel:

J = (1/2)mr²  
m = mass (0.1 kg)
r = radius (meters, need this value)

At steady state:

V = IR + Kω
T = KI = Load torque

Final speed-voltage relationship (steady state):

ω = (V/K) - (R/K²)T_load

If load torque is small:
ω ≈ V/K

To get exact values, you need:

    Motor constant K
    Wheel radius
    Load torque (friction, air resistance)
    No-load speed at rated voltage
