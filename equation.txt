Kω is back-EMF
    faster, Kw bigger
    
V = IR + Kω
    I = (V - Kw)/R
    faster, I smaller
    
T = KI
    faster, T smaller
    T = K(V - Kw)/R
    
Assume no load, Battery Volt 12v, final speed is 20r/s
w ~= V/K
    K = V/w = 12/20
    
For wheel Moment of inertia
J = (1/2)mr^2

For  move of wheel
T is the net toque to the wheel Tnet = Ttotal - Tload
T = J(dw/dt)
dw = (T/J)*dt
